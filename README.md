Typescript Library for Steem

No longer supported, although I don't think this was finished, not interested in maintaining and is also for steem which I've stopped using entirely (switch to Hive!).

This is a typescript library written for interaction with Steem. Currently in progress, under an MIT license. Bugs, Issues, and PRs welcome.
